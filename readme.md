## What's Inside? (The Fun Stuff)

* **Track Your Accounts**: Add and manage your financial accounts, such as bank accounts, credit cards, and savings.
* **Log Transactions**: Easily add, edit, and delete transactions for each account.
* **Real-time Balances**: Account balances are automatically updated as you add or modify transactions.
* **Your Dashboard, Your Rules**: A clean and simple interface to view your financial overview.
* **Match Your Vibe**: Switch between a slick dark mode and a clean light mode.
* **Keep It To Yourself**: A simple login keeps your personal dashboard private. The first person to sign up becomes the one and only admin and user.

## Bringing Your Dashboard to Life

Ready to get your own dashboard up and running? You've got two paths to choose from.

### What You'll Need

* Python 3.x (if you're going the local route)
* Docker and Docker Compose (if you want the easy setup)

### Option 1: The Docker Way (Easy Mode)

This is the fastest way to get started.

1.  **Clone this repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/them3rcury/easy-finance
    cd easy-finance
    ```

2.  **Let Docker do the magic:**
    This single command builds the container and gets everything running.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3.  **You're in!**
    Open your browser and head to `http://localhost:5000`.

### Option 2: The Local Setup (Hands-On Mode)

Hereâ€™s how to run it on your machine locally.

1.  **Clone this repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/them3rcury/easy-finance
    cd easy-finance
    ```

2.  **Setup the venv:**
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install the goodies:**
    This will grab all the Python packages the project needs.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Launch it!**
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        export FLASK_APP=app.py
        flask run
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```sh
        set FLASK_APP=app.py
        flask run
        ```

5.  **Use it!**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## A Note on Your First Run

The very first time you launch the app, it'll ask you to create an account. This first account is specialâ€”it's the one and only user account for your dashboard.

* **Flask** for the backend
* **Flask-SQLAlchemy** for the database
* **Vanilla JavaScript** for the interactive frontend (no complex frameworks!)
* **Docker** for easy-peasy containerization
